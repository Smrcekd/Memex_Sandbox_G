  <p style=“line-height: 150%“> <font size="+1"> Year <span class="ID"><b>1897</b></span> is considered to be both a turning point for the stability of the monarchy and a peak of the collective violence in the lands of the Bohemian Crown. The cause of this was the Language ordinances, equalization of Czech and German as an internal official language in Bohemia. German obstruction following their publication caused a long-lasting parliamentary crisis and became a precedent for dealing with political problems in the monarchy in a highly destructive manner. Over the year, the politicians and media transferred the parliamentary disputes to the public space, causing collective violence against minorities in cities of Bohemia. The wave of unrest peaked by the end of November, bringing the demonstrations into Vienna, eventually causing the fall of Badeni’s government.
  Cities with the Czech majority erupted into demonstrations and riots, with their center in Prague, where the unrest presented <i>the most distinct example of the anti-German and anti-Semitic collective violence during the whole “long” 19th century.</i> After four days of looting and plundering, martial law was declared over Prague and its surrounding districts, ending the most violent part of 1897.</font></p>
